                            Buildinfo Requirements

The following are requirements must be met when submitting buildinfo files (or
the equivalent files for other buildscript drivers, such as PKGBUILDs). If any
one of them is not met, it is grounds for having the submission rejected:

1.  The buildinfo file (or equivalent if usind a different format) must not
    have any hard coded version numbers. Everywhere the version number needs to
    be referenced, the $VERSION variable (or equivalent) should be used instead.
2.  All download links must be listed the URL variable (or equivatlent). And
    must use variables sufficiently.
3.  All build dependencies (except for the packages that are included in 
    stage 1) must be listed.
4.  There must be some sort of source integreity verification in place. The
    following verification methods are considered adequate on their own: PGP
    signatures, SHA512 checksums and SHA256 checksums. SHA1 and MD5 checksums
    are not adequate on their own; if you use one of these checksums, then you
    must have at least one other verification method in place as well.
5.  pkgapi functions must be used whenever possible (for .buildinfo files only).
6.  The package must build correctly on a clean installation.
