       Instructions for Updating Packages from Cucumber Linux 1.1 to 2.0

  3. Submitting the Updated Package Source Directory

§ Introduction

To update a package for Cucumber Linux 2.0, there are two tasks that must be
done. These are detailed below:

  1. Convert the 1.x formatted buildscript to a buildinfo.
  2. Update the package to the new version.

It is often easier to do both steps 1 and 2 in one sitting. If they are done at
the same time, there is certain redundant work that can be eliminated.

§1. Convert the 1.x Formatted Buildscript to a Buildinfo

Start by importing the source from the Cucumber Linux 1.1 tree
(https://mirror.cucumberlinux.com/cucumber/cucumber-1.1/source/) into the ports
tree. When doing this, the package's directory should go in
ports/cucumber/<group>, where <group> is the package group it was in for
Cucumber Linux 1.1.

All of the Cucumber Linux 1.1 buildscripts need to be converted. To aid in this
process, there is a script at
ports/utilities/tools/convert-buildscript-to-buildinfo. Run this script, passing
the buildscript you wish to convert in as an argument. The script is self
guided.

Once the script has run, YOU ARE NOT DONE YET. At the end of the script, it
will state several additional things that need to be done:
* Update the copyright line to include your name and the current year.
* Change the '#Do the actual build' section to use pkgapi_make instead of make.
  Note that only the main make command should use pkgapi_make; the other make
  commands (like make install) should still use plain make.
* If 'cat << EOF' is used anywhere in the buildscript, it will be necessary to
  unindent those lines.
* Verify that the checksums in sha512sums are correct and cover all of the
  necessary files.
* Add signature verification (if desired; this is not strictly required but it
  makes updating the package substantially easier). An example of how to do this
  can be found in the gcc package.

Finally, make sure the buildinfo file meets all of the requirements listed in
ports/utilities/documentation/requirements-for-package-submission.

Now the conversion is complete.

§2. Update the Package to the New Version

Please update the packages to the version listed at
https://mirror.cucumberlinux.com/sandbox/cucumber-2.0/Cucumber-Linux-2.0-Package-Versions.html
if the packages is listed on the webpage. If the package is not listed on that
webpage, then update the whatever the latest stable version is.  If you think
there is a good reason to make an exception to these guidelines for a package,
talk to Scott about it.

When updating packages to the new version, all that should be necessary is the
following:

  1. Change the VERSION variable in the buildinfo file to the new version.
  2. Update the checksums.

Then verify that the new version builds correctly. One easy way to do this is to
run:

	portmake download && sudo portmake build-recursive

If that results in a package tarball being made, then the update was likely
successful.

§3. Submitting the Updated Package Source Directory

Before submitting an updated package, make sure it meets all the requirements
from ports/utilities/documentation/requirements-for-package-submission.

Then, submit a pull request on GitHub (https://github.com/cucumberlinux/ports).
