  1. Purpose
  2. Usage

§1. Purpose

Metapackages exist to trigger the building of several other packages; when a
metapackage is built using portmake, it will cause portmake to build these other
packages.

§2. Usage

Metapackages make use of the metapackage buildscript driver, found at
utilities/drivers/metapackage.buildscript. This driver does nothing except list
build time dependencies. These build time dependencies are the packages that
will be built when building the metapackage.

Build time dependencies should be listed in a file called 'packages' in the same
directory as the buildscript. Dependencies should be listed in order, separated
by any kind of whitespace. Lines beginning with a # will be ignored, allowing
for comments.
