                          README - Tool Descriptions

This directory contains a bunch of tools for working with the ports system.
Here is a brief description of what each one does:

§ generate-cucumber-buildinfo-template
Generates a template buildinfo directory. This is useful when creating a
buildinfo for a new package as it automates a good amount of the work. It will
create a new directory in the current directory and place the buildinfo file
(along with the other supporting files) in it. The resulting files will require
some additional editing to work properly. Full documentation for the
generate-cucumber-buildinfo-template tool and buildinfo files can be found in
ports/utilities/documentation/cucumber-buildinfo.

§ portmake
Automates the process of building packages in the ports tree. It uses the
buildscript driver to handle many of the tasks (such as downloading the source,
verifying the integerity of the source, building the package and building
dependencies). Information on using portmake can be obtained by running
`portmake help`. Documentation on how to build, install and update packages
using portmake can be found in ports/utilities/documentation/building-packages.
