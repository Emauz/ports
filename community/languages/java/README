This directory contains the buildscript for building Oracle's Java Runtime and
Development Environments. It repackages the official Oracle tarballs into
packages that can be managed using Cucumber Linux's package management tools.

To use this, you'll need to download Oracles' Java tarballs. They can be found
at https://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp. Make sure to get the
.tar.gz files, not the RPM ones, and make sure to download the correct
architecture.

Save the downloaded file to the same directory as the buildscript, and then run:

./java.buildscript jre-8u101-linux-x64.tar.gz

This will create a Cucumber Linux compatible package in /tmp, which can now be
installed or upgraded via installpkg or upgradepkg respectively.
