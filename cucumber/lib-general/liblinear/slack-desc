# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

liblinear: This package provides a library for learning linear classifiers for 
liblinear: large scale applications. It supports Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
liblinear: with L2 and L1 loss, logistic regression, multi class classification 
liblinear: and also Linear Programming Machines (L1-regularized SVMs). Its 
liblinear: computational complexity scales linearly with the number of training 
liblinear: examples making it one of the fastest SVM solvers around.
