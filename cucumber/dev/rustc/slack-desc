# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rustc: Its design is oriented toward concerns of "programming in the large",
rustc: that is, of creating and maintaining boundaries - both abstract and
rustc: operational - that preserve large-system integrity, availability,
rustc: and concurrency.
