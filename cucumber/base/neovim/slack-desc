# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

neovim: (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a
neovim: continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist,
neovim: some very clever--but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want
neovim: the good parts of Vim, and more.

neovim: Neovim is developed primarily by Justin M. Keyes with assistance from
neovim: various other developers. Website: https://neovim.io/
