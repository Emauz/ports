The certdata.txt file contains raw Certificate Authority Cerficates as provided
by Mozilla in the NSS library. To get an updated list of certificates, extract
the file nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt from the latest version of the NSS
sources (see cucumber/lib-base/nss). This is done automatically when running
the buildscript.
