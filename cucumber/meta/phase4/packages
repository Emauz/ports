# This metapackage builds the Cucumber Linux phase 4 packages. It attempts to
# follow the original build order from Cucumber Linux 1.0 as closely as
# possible. The actual Cucumber Linux 1.0 build order can be found at:
# http://mirror.cucumberlinux.com/cucumber/cucumber-1.0/CHANGELOG

# Phase 4 builds the remaining packages in the /cucumber directory of the ports
# tree that are not built in phases 2 or 3. At the end of phase 4, the system
# is complete.
