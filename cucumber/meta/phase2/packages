# This metapackage builds the Cucumber Linux phase 2 packages. It attempts to
# follow the original build order from Cucumber Linux 1.0 as closely as
# possible (which was largely based off of Linux from Scratch 7.9). The actual
# Cucumber Linux 1.0 build order can be found at:
# https://z5t1.com/cucumber/wiki/buildsystem

# Phase 2 builds an initial bootstrap system. At the end of phase 2, the system
# is capable of running itself (without the /tools directory), but is not be
# capable of compiling itself.
